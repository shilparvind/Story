Got my Wacom tablet today. No clue what it is.

UFF UFF UFF UFF UFF UFF

I am making changes now. Lets use the gitbash commands now and see the difference. 

Will make changes to this story. First i will do checkout and then will create a branch.

I am making changes to the story remotely. 

Making changes without pull command

I could see errors. I fixed it by using add, then commit. It worked. 
SO if the remote is ahead, first pull and then push the local directory changes.
Use git status to see if remote is ahead to local repository.
